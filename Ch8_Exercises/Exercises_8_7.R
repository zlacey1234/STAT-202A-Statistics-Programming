## 2. Which of the following is true:
##
##    a. The graph above is a histogram. 
##    b. The graph above shows only four members with a bar plot.

##
##    Which of the following statements is true:
##
##    a. It is impossible that they are from the same dataset.
##    b. They are from the same dataset, but the plots are different due 
##       to code errors.
##    c. They are the same dataset, but the first and second plot 
##       under-smooth and the third over-smooths.
##    d. They are the same dataset, but the first is not in the log scale,
